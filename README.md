This will be the migration of gdms from web2py to py4web framework.  However we are not just looking to recreate the same thing.  This should be streamlined and focussed much more on being a tool for individuals to properly self-manage.  We will recognise that most decisions will remain individual for the time being and so this will focus on being easy to use in that manner with the option to then refer things to appropriate groups as and when required.
