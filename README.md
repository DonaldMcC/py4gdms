This project is the migration of gdms from web2py to py4web framework.  
We are not just looking to recreate the same thing.  

This has been streamlined and focussed much more on being a tool for individuals to properly self-manage.  
We recognise that most decisions will remain individual for the time being and so this will focus on being easy to use. 

The issue remains that there is no accepted method for medium and large scale participative decision making.
Evidence suggest six is the maximum number you should have at decision making meeting. 
I believe an asynchronous decision making approach is required and might revolutionise decision making and empower groups
to achieve much more.  This is probably also the challenge in that the adoption of such an approach terrifies current
leaders.
