Planning to pick-up activity on this asynchronous decision-making platform as still convinced these are a key opportunity for human led progress and that AI represents a key opportunity that such a framework could hope to leverage to produce a more balanced and consensual approach to progress.  I still have huge concerns that the combination of controligarch driven agendas, divisive politics and over-borrowing will lead to a significant crisis most likely before this decade is out.  I donâ€™t envisage tools like this will avoid the crisis but if established they may help us all navigate it better.

This project is the migration of gdms from web2py to py4web framework.  
We are not just looking to recreate the same thing.  

This has been streamlined and focussed much more on being a tool for individuals to properly self-manage.  
We recognise that most decisions will remain individual for the time being and so this will focus on being easy to use. 

The issue remains that there is no accepted method for medium and large scale participative decision making.
Evidence suggest six is the maximum number you should have at decision making meeting. 
I believe an asynchronous decision making approach is required and might revolutionise decision making and empower groups
to achieve much more.  This is probably also the challenge in that the adoption of such an approach terrifies current
leaders.
